# Analyze GPX tracks

I got a little worried that Polar GritX doesn't show very correctly maximum speed in downhill skiing (among other sports) and looked at that more in detail. Here is a small piece of code to self-analyze gpx tracks and example gpx file.

Polar GritX gave max speed of 75.7 km/h for this run
